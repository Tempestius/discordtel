DiscordTel is a bot for Discord that enables you to set up a custom number and call others using the bot.

The bot *acts* like a telephone network, but **cannot** make real-world calls.

You can >dial `*611` if you have any problems or questions about the bot, or if there is a problem within your server that involves trollers/spammers.

So, ready to *dive* into a world of DiscordTel?
